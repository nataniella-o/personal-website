                    Hi again! üëãüèæ¬†
                    <br><br>I‚Äôm Nataniella, a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate from the University of Manitoba.
                    <br><br>I‚Äôve always loved building things, whether it‚Äôs a new app, a LEGO masterpiece, or meaningful connections. 
                    My passion for problem-solving led me to Computer Science, where I‚Äôve discovered a love for creating tools that make people‚Äôs lives better.

            <h2>My Journey.</h2>
            <p>
                During my time as a Computer Science student, I‚Äôve had the privilege of exploring different aspects of the tech world. 
                My internship at the AI4Good Lab gave me hands-on experience in [specific skills or projects, e.g., building web applications, debugging code, or collaborating in a development team]. 
                It showed me how the right tools can make a big difference in solving real-world problems.
                <br><br>Beyond the classroom, I‚Äôve been an active member of the UofM¬†Women in Computer Science (UMWICS) Student Group, where I was the Treasurer from May 2022 - 2024.
                        I assisted in organizing events to empower more women to pursue careers in tech. 
                        Supporting and inspiring women of colour to break into this field is something I‚Äôm deeply passionate about.
                <br><br>Additionally, my three years in retail have shaped who I am today. From sharpening my communication skills, learning how to problem-solve on the spot and getting accustomed to team dynamics. 
                        I always bring these lessons into every project I work on.
                <br><br>Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring¬†Full-Stack development,¬†UI/UX design, and¬†Artificial Intelligence, 
                        with the goal of contributing to products that make life better for users.

            <h2>My Aspirations.</h2>
            <p>
                I hope to work with innovative companies to build products that prioritize user experience and accessibility. 
                I also aim to inspire the next generation of women in tech through mentorship and advocacy.
